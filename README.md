## Accessibility Improvements for UpLift

This repository contains accessibility improvements made to UpLift's website as
part of my application for the Frontend engineer position.

### Navigation: "Skip to Content" Option

- Added a "Skip to Content" link to enhance user experience, particularly for
  screen reader users.
- This link allows users to bypass the navigation menu and jump directly to the
  main content of the page.

### Keyboard Access: Improved the "For Providers" Option on the Nav

- Enhanced keyboard accessibility for the "For Providers" option on the
  navigation bar.
- Users can now easily navigate in and out of the dropdown using the up and down
  arrow keys.
- The changes make the website more inclusive for users who rely on keyboard
  navigation.

### FAQs: Rewrote the FAQs to be more accessible

- Rewrote the FAQs to be more accessible for screen reader users.
- Users can now tab through the FAQs one by one and press enter or space bar to
  expand the answer.

### Live Demo

- A live demo of the website with the accessibility improvements can be found
  [here](https://uplift-website.vercel.app/).
