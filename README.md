## Accessibility Improvements for DeepWhale AI

This repository contains accessibility improvements made to DeepWhale AI's
website as part of my application for the Frontend engineer position.

### Navigation: "Skip to Content" Option

- Added a "Skip to Content" link to enhance user experience, particularly for
  screen reader users.
- This link allows users to bypass the navigation menu and jump directly to the
  main content of the page.

### Keyboard Access: "Sign Up" Button and Login Page

- Enhanced keyboard accessibility for the "Sign Up" button in the navigation bar
  and the login page.
- Users can now easily navigate to and interact with these elements using
  keyboard controls.
- The changes make the website more inclusive for users who rely on keyboard
  navigation.

### Live Demo

- A live demo of the website with the accessibility improvements can be found
  [here](https://deepwhale-ai.vercel.app/).
